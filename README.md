## üç™About Axeptio
[Axeptio](https://www.axept.io/) is a highly configurable **Consent Management Platform (CMP)** that enables websites to collect, manage, and store user consent data in a **transparent** and **privacy-first** manner. It is designed to facilitate compliance with global data privacy laws such as **GDPR** and the **ePrivacy Directive**. Axeptio allows users to customize consent forms and manage user preferences with ease while offering a seamless experience across web environments.
<br><br>
## Key Features of Axeptio
- **Full compliance** with GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive.
- **Customizable and intuitive** interface for users, ensuring flexibility in implementation.
- **Seamless integration** with existing cookie management tools.
- **Dynamic script management**, enabling scripts to load based on user consent status.

<br><br> 

## Benefits of Using sGTM with Axeptio
By leveraging **GTM Server-Side** (sGTM) with Axeptio, organizations can enhance the consent management process with multiple key benefits:

- **Prolonged Cookie Lifespan**: Cookies can be securely managed and extended on the server side, reducing the restrictions imposed by client-side limitations such as cookie expiration or privacy controls.
- **Enhanced Data Security**: Server-side tagging minimizes the exposure of sensitive data on the client side, offering added protection for user consent and other personal data.
- **Improved Performance**: Offloading tag management to the server reduces the load on the client side, resulting in faster page loads and a more optimized user experience.
- **Better Control and Compliance** Server-side management of user consent data ensures that you have full control over the flow of data between your website and third-party services, minimizing risks related to privacy breaches.
